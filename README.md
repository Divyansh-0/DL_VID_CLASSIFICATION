## Video Understanding with Deep Learning: A Comparative Study

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive study comparing various CNN architectures for video understanding tasks.

**Abstract:**

Computer vision has witnessed significant advancements, particularly in image recognition driven by supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, video understanding presents unique challenges due to its temporal nature. This project investigates the performance of different CNN architectures for video analysis, including VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, and EfficientNet. We evaluate these models on benchmark video datasets, considering factors like accuracy, computational efficiency, and handling variable-length input sequences.
